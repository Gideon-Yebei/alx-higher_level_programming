# The `this` module is a bit of an easter egg in Python. When imported, it doesn't provide any functions, classes, or variables that you can use in your code. Instead, it automatically prints a poem to the console. The poem is "The Zen of Python", by Tim Peters, which outlines some of the guiding principles behind the design of the Python language. It's a bit of fun, but also a useful reminder of what Python is all about.
